                    <h3>Project 2 "Pretty Much Complete!"</h3>
                        <p>Is anyone really done with their projects? There always seems to be something more to do. I estimated assignment #2 to take me 10 hours...... It took me 10 hours to get frustrated enough to completely scrub and re-do the css. Then it took me 6 hours to get "pretty much complete". Total time 16 hours. 2 of those hours was spent fighting github. 3 hours fussing about with the HTML structure. The rest was all CSS... Learning this. Learning that. I still have a long way to go with flexbox. I still dont think it is working right.</p>

                    <h3>Things that concern me about the class:</h3>
                     <p>My biggest concern about what I am doing in this class has to do with a beast that has haunted me my whole life, and yet has still not managed to take a bite out of me: The fear of not keeping up or not holding up my end; and that this fear will disrupt my focus and overcome my ability to absorb the information as it is presented. That I will somehow (I know it's a little bizarre) become a burden on the instructor and his TA's and slow the rest of the class down. To my knowledge this has never actually happened to me, but it remains a fear I struggle with. Not holding up my end scares me. The things that trigger this fear are as follows:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="redText">Not being familiar with my new Mac. There are little annoying differences between this new MAC and my PC that keep arising during class at the most inopportune times.</span></li>

                             <li><span class="redText">Seeing that I know less about coding than my other classmates. I hate not knowing as much or more than the people around me!</span></li>

                              <li><span class="redText">That slightly "swimming" feeling I get when I am trying to overcome my end-of-the-day drop in energy, combined with trying to keep up with, or remember what is being shown during class while overcoming some small difference in the way my MAC is used vs. my Windows based Acer. Grrrrr.... </span></li>

                    <h3>August 4th. First class of Primer Pro.</h3>
                    <p>Tonight's class went really well. I thought the change in rooms was a good call. For some reason, the layout, size, and even color of the room seemed to help. The class atmosphere also seemed to be a bit more relaxed. Not sure exactly why. Perhaps less students? Maybe, but I think there was a certain conifdence felt in most people at having "survived" the first Primer Class, lol. </p>
                    <p>I feel that this class seemed more "interactive" for some reason, and I liked that. The presentation was great as usual. </p>
                    <p>I'm wondering if it might be more beneficial to take breaks at 7 and 8 only, and for 10-15 minutes, allowing people to get up, take a bathroom break, and sit back down and mess with codepen, look something up, apply something learned on their webdev-notebook, ect. It seems that on the longer breaks this is what I have observed most people do (including myself) and it feels very helpful. The first break 1/2 hour into the sesson has only really distracted me and feels like an unwelcome break in flow. After my commute to class, I'm usually ready to go and focused at the beginning. Breaks later in the class are the ones that really seem to help me keep my focus. I wonder how others feel about this.</p>
                    <p> Also, for whatever reason, navigating the Github content to follow along with on our computers, is a little time consuming and distracting (such as the Responsive Design PDF last night). As a suggestion, perhaps it should be pulled up on the projection screen, gone over, and then the link posted on Slack during the break or at the end, as most people can see the screen and the focus will be kept on the instructor instead of individual computer screens and keyboard goings-on. I know I have gotten caught up in trying to find the correct Github section and missed some of the oral presentation.</p>
                    <p>All in all, great class!</p>
